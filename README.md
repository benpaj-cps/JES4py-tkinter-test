# JES-emulator

[**JES**](https://github.com/gatech-csl/jes), the Jython Environment for Students, is an educational IDE used in the Media Computation curriculum developed by Mark Guzdial and Barbara Ericson at Georgia Tech. More details on the curriculum are available at http://www.mediacomputation.org/.  

[**Jython**](https://www.jython.org/) is a Java implementation of Python 2.x and was designed to allow rapid application development and scripting access to Java functionality.

The **JES-Emulator** implements a subset of JES features that can be used in Python 2.x and Python 3.x scripts.  The goal is to provide the pedogocial assets of JES without requiring Jython or needing to use JES's IDE.
